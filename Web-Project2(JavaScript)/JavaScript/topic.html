      <h2 id="intro">1.Introduction:</h2>
      <p>VoIP stands for Voice over Internet Protocol.It can be defined as the transmission of voice and multimedia conten over Internet Protocol.It is a device that is designed for the user to use the internet to make and recieve phone calls.The other name of VoIP is " IP Telephony".It is available in different range of services.Even some free VoIPservices require all the parties to be at their computers for dialing or recieving phone calls.Also there is a traditional phone available with a special adaptor instead of VoIP phone.Mainly for a VoIP Broadband internet connection is used which enables a phone or software on a computer.It is enabled by multiple group of technologies and methodologies which deliver voice communications all over the internet,local area networks(LAN>,wide area network(WAN). </p>
      <h2 id="Technology">2. Technology:</h2>
      <p>
        The technology of VoIP generally uses International Telecommunication Union(ITU) standard codecs which is the standard form of sending the packets as well as also used for sending compressed packets.Many international equipment vendors use their own proprietary codecs.There may not be proper satisfaction with voice when compression is used ,but it reduces bandwidth requirements.It typically supports all non-voice communications.The session initiation protocol is often used to signal that is necessary to create,maintain and end calls.
         
      </p>
      <h2 id="working">3.How it Works ?</h2>
      <p>Voice over Internet Protocol uses codecs(an Algorithm) to encapsulate the voice into data packets and then transmit the packets across an IP network<br>
         and then unencapsulates the packet back into the voice at the other side of the connection.On eliminating the use of circuit-switched networks for audio,<br>
         VoIP reduces the network infrastructure costs,enables providers to send voice services over their broadband and private networks,allowing enterprices to<br>
          operate voice and data network.It works faster on IP based networks to communicate between endpoints and networks.</p>

      <h2 id="points">4.Key Features:</h2>
      <p>The key features of VoIP are as follows:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Voicemail</li>
          <li>DND(Do not Disturb)</li>
          <li>Conferencing</li>
          <li>Auto Attendent</li>
          <li>Call recording</li>
        </ol> 
        <h2 id="development">Development History:</h2> 
        <p>The inventor of VoIP is Alon Cohen who was born in Israel ,1962 also known as the co-founder of VocalTec(1989) and co-inventor of the Audio Transcevier which enabled the creation of Voice over Networks products and eventually the VoIP industry.The idea regarding the concept of VoIP was implemented from year 1973 but finally developed in 1995.The VoIP developed at that time was connected only when the sender and reciever had the same source.Later on, more advanced technologies were created regarding this topic.</p>    
        <h2 id="growth">Data Analysis:</h2>

        <p>When VoIP was developed, inthe same year,three different companies introduced VoIP switching software as standard add-ons in their routine equipment.This accessibility meant that by 2003,the number of VoIP calls dropped significantly to 25% of all voice calls.Then the avaibility of the Ehernet services meant that there was improvement in connections.Communications hardware manufacturers began producing equipment for VoIP calling that switch.It progressed a lot as it was noticed by the users that VoIP caliing was a great way of connecting with the internet and getting a bit cheaper. </p>
